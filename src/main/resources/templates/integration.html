    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      The calculation of on-ground distance is relatively simple when using a bird‚Äôs eye view compared to a street-level
      perspective. In addition, object occlusion is infrequent in a bird‚Äôs eye view,
      resulting in an unobstructed view of objects. However, pedestrian detection is more accurate from a street-level
      perspective because pedestrians appear smaller from a bird‚Äôs eye view. To address this issue, we integrate the
      results obtained from both cameras to provide more precise traffic and pedestrian-related information compared to
      using only a single view.

    <h3>Algorithm</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Temporal alignment</b>:
        <p>Find the frames with the time stamps from the two cameras (to support integration). We can set a threshold
          ùõÖ,
          if |t_Ams- t_120| < ùõÖ, we can say that they are frames with the same time stamp.</p>
      </li>
      <li><b>Spatial alignment</b>:
        <p>
          Accurate on-ground coordinate calculation from the 2nd-floor camera requires multi-area calibration, i.e.,
          calibrating each area individually. Therefore, to achieve temporal alignment, we determined the corresponding
          areas from the perspective of the 12th-floor camera as well. For each detected
          pedestrian/vehicle on both cameras, the area it lies in, and its on-ground coordinates with respect to the
          origin of that area are calculated. This allows objects detected in different views to be spatially aligned.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>Integration</b>:
        <p>
          All the pedestrians/vehicles detected from both cameras are integrated, and the objects with high occlusion
          are
          removed.
